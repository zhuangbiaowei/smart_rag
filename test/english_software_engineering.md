# Software Engineering Essentials

Software engineering focuses on building reliable, maintainable systems. It combines technical practices with teamwork, planning, and continuous improvement.

## Requirements and Scope

Clear requirements reduce rework and help teams prioritize. Scope boundaries keep projects aligned with business goals.

## Design and Architecture

Good architecture balances simplicity, scalability, and change tolerance. Modular design makes systems easier to test and evolve.

## Testing and Quality

Testing improves confidence and prevents regressions. Automated unit and integration tests catch issues early.

## Delivery and Operations

Continuous delivery shortens feedback loops. Monitoring and incident response keep systems healthy in production.
