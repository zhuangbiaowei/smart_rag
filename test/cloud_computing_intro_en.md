# Cloud Computing Overview

Cloud computing delivers on-demand computing resources over the internet. It replaces large upfront infrastructure costs with pay-as-you-go services.

## Service Models

- **IaaS**: Infrastructure as a service (virtual machines, storage, networking)
- **PaaS**: Platform as a service (managed runtimes, databases, deployment)
- **SaaS**: Software as a service (complete applications delivered via browser)

## Deployment Models

1. **Public Cloud**: Shared infrastructure operated by a cloud provider
2. **Private Cloud**: Dedicated infrastructure for a single organization
3. **Hybrid Cloud**: Mix of public and private resources with shared governance

## Core Concepts

### Virtualization

Virtualization isolates workloads and improves hardware utilization. It enables rapid provisioning and scaling.

### Elasticity

Elastic systems scale up or down based on demand. This helps control cost and performance.

### Shared Responsibility

Providers secure the cloud platform; customers secure their data, identities, and configurations.

## Common Use Cases

- Web hosting and APIs
- Data analytics and batch processing
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Machine learning and AI pipelines
